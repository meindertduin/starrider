# Starrider Engine
A work in progress game engine written and to be written in c++. The goal of the project is to do as much from scratch as possible.

## Features (for now)
- Software rasterization
- 32 bit texture mapping
- Simple light shading
- Pixel alpha blending
- TTF and Bitmap font support 

## Requirements
- Freetype 2
- A system with Xlib and MIT-SHM headers available. Most unix systems should be fine with x-server installed.

## Contributing
As much as i like the idea of working with multiple people on a game engine, I won't be accepting
any code contributions as of now. Altough if you see any issues within the code that hurt your c++ programming brain, you're more than welcome to raise an issue to this project, so we can have a discussion. The purpose of this project is mainly to learn low level graphics programming
and game development. And also to have a bit of fun with with topics I'm interessted in. Maybe if the Engine is in a more mature state, I will
allow contributions.
