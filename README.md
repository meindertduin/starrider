# Starrider Engine
A work in progress game engine written in c++, with as much from scrach as possible. Will be finished somewhere in 2040 :P

## Features
- Software rasterization
- Xlib integration
- 32 bit texture mapping
- Texture alpha blending
- TTF and Bitmap font support
- Loading meshes from .obj files

## Requirements
- Freetype2
- Xlib with MIT-SHM

## Contributing
As much as i like the idea of working with multiple people on a game engine, I won't be accepting
any contributions as of now. The purpose of this project is mainly to learn low level graphics programming
and game development and to have a bit of fun with that. Maybe if the Engine is in a more mature state, I will
allow contributions.
